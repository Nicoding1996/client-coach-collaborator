This is a coaching portal if you need files/ code files for more info just tell me for now mostly is a design and no functions yet like the buttons, search bar filters, view profile or edit. I want them to function as well update and connect each other like for example if i schedule a session in my session tab it should reflect in the dashboard another example if i update my invoice it should reflect in the dash. 

but before that we should make the buttons working:

in the clients:

1. search bar should work
2. Filter and recent button should work
3.profile and message should work

in Session:

1. able to schedule a session
2. filter button able to work
3. able to see notes 
4. remove the join button
5. add an edit session button to edit/remove a session

In invoices: 

1. the create an invoice button should work
2. able to view, export and download invoice
3. be able to change the status of the invoice and the due date
4. Search bar should work


and i have tasks in my dash board give me suggestion for to integrate and make it function in the platform

how do i go about this? is it stop by stop or all in one to make in connect? i will be using chat gpt on cursor ai
